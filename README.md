Hi! Glad you hear))

At the moment, the project is a regular regisration form. A feature is the validation functionality. Validation of user input is implemented without the use of additional scripts. This is possible thanks to the combined use of default validation mechanisms built into HTML and extensive regular expression capabilities.
